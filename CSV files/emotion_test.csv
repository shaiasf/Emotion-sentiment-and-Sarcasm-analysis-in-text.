"Love is the key to happiness. We all want to lead a happy life. People look around for happiness in power, fashion, wealth, drugs etc. But these things can only give temporary pleasures. The power of love can create miracles. Love can create unity among nations and its citizens. Love is the most beautiful feeling in the world. Love has given different meaning by different people depending upon how they have experienced this wonderful feeling."
"One day I was studying in my room when, all of a sudden, i heard hot words being exchanged between two persons in the street. I paid no attention, thinking it would be a minor quarrel but soon I heard the voices of a large number of people. I peeped from the window and saw that there was a street quarrel. I went downstairs and reached the spot in the twinkling of an eyes. I was at my wits end on seeing that both of them had come to blows. The people were standing around them and enjoying their quarrel but none tried to pacify them."
